## Course Description
A presentation of signals and systems that does not rely on prior knowledge of electrical circuits or differential equations. Sine waves, phasors, continuous-time and discrete-time signals, sampling. Starting from elementary discrete-time systems (FIR filters), and moving on to more complex systems (IIR digital filters and analog filters), concepts such as impulse response, convolution, frequency response, transfer functions (z transform and Laplace transform) are presented. Block and signal-flow diagrams. Linearity, causality, time invariance, stability. Feedback: open loop and closed-loop gain. Transientresponse, poles and zeros. Vector spaces of signals, Fourier analysis, modulated signals, random signals.Examples include speech and audio signals, communication and control systems. Extensive use of MATLAB.
